# Running Tests

## Prerequisites

You need a Cloudmersive API key to run the tests against the live API. The default mock run needs no credentials.

## Test environments

The suite runs in two modes.

| Mode | How to run | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Mock server (default) | `bal test` | Requests are served by `tests/mock_service.bal` on `localhost:9090` |
| Live server | `IS_LIVE_SERVER=true CLOUDMERSIVE_API_KEY=<key> bal test` | Requests go to `https://api.cloudmersive.com/currency/exchange-rates` |

The tests read `IS_LIVE_SERVER` and `CLOUDMERSIVE_API_KEY` from the environment.

## Coverage

One test per operation: `listAvailableCurrencies`, `convertCurrency` and `getExchangeRate`. Each is tagged with the `live_tests` and `mock_tests` groups.

```bash
bal test --groups mock_tests
```
